% Ray Angle is defined as the altitude angle on a horizontal surface
% starting on the "right side" (first quadrat of coordinate system). It can
% be used directly for the ground surface but needs to be shifted by +pi/2
% and -pi/2 for the wall surfaces as the walls are vertical in our
% coordinate system. It also needs to be shifted according to the
% orientation of the tangent of the emitting point on the tree circle.

% The emitting point needs to be slightly moved away from the surface.
% Otherwise, it will be counted as crossing itself. stc defines how much a
% point is moved away from the surface
